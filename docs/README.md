# Brain Training

Brain Training is designed to be a game that pushes you to your limits, and lets you compete against your most worthy foe, yourself.

You have 3 levels to choose from where you will have to match cards to their corresponding match in as little time, and as little moves as possible. Once you've completed the levels, feel free to share your scores with your friends and push each other to improve!

## UX

This site is designed for everyone of every age to enjoy and to test their skills. It's minimalist in features, focusing on the game itself along with a help menu and a dark mode feature.

For inspiration, I referenced sites like [Helpful Games](https://www.helpfulgames.com/subjects/brain-training/memory.html).

The basic functionality and level progression is how I pictured it, but I put my own spin on the design itself.

Design Features Include:

* **Press Start 2P Font** - This makes it feel very much like NES and like a throwback 90s game, which is intended.

* **Darkmode** - This gives the user to change the color theme based on their preference.

* **How to Play** - A quick instructional is provided on the home page so the user knows exactly what they are getting into before they play.

* **Fixed Hero Images** - Striking hero images give the site a uniform and beautiful display.

* **Mobile Menu** - Consolidating the menu down for mobile devices lets it be flexible for device size.
